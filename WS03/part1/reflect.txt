Workshop 6  focussed on classes and resources.In the first workshop  that  created 2 classes and keep  first classes member variable and 
member function private. As a result, forward declared the emailfile class and dissalow constructor , To use the email class i create a 
function in email function like  (friend class EmailFile;). This workshop made me realize giving up is not an option.
